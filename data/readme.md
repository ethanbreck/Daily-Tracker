This Readme is included, to make sure that the folder is there incase you decide to use this daily tracker.

There are not that many features, mainly just running the program, and entering a number, but i am looking at including more features in the future, depending on what people ask for.

Currently, it just has going to and leaving the bathroom, taking a shower, and leaving the shower, going to and from school and work, working on an eagle project, since that is something i am working on, Going on the bus, and getting off the bus, and that is it. 

I have made the .json files for each activity private, as im sure those that use the program, probably dont want their lives public, but if you are okay sharing that, you can just remove the .json files at the top of the .gitignore file, I have labeled it personal exceptions.



Test:
